This package contains the model objects that are exchanged between clients and a Gnip server.  Model objects are used
by the Gnip client library in two basic ways:
<ol>
    <li>
        As Java object representations of XML objects that exist on a Gnip server.  For example, {@link Filter filters}
        or {@link Publisher publishers} that already exist on a Gnip server can be requested using a
        {@link GnipConnection} which will send an HTTP request that returns XML which is marshalled into a Java
        model object.
    </li>
    <li>
        As Java objects that will be converted into XML to send to a Gnip server.  For example, an
        {@link Activities activities} object can be created and populated with {@link Activity activity} data
        and then published to a Publisher via {@link GnipConnection}.  This will convert the Java model
        objects into XML and transmit them over HTTP to a Gnip server.
    </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
Subscribers interested in reading data from Gnip will be particularly interested in {@link Publisher publishers},
{@link Filter filters}, {@link Rule rules}, and {@link RuleType rule types}.  These objects can be used as sources
of {@link Activity activity} dat.
<br/>
<br/>
Publishers interested in writing data to Gnip will be particularly interested in {@link Publisher publishers} and
{@link Activities activities} to which {@link Activity activity} data wrapping an {@link Payload activity payload}
can be sent.
